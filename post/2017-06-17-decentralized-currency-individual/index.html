        <p>Crypto-currencies led by Bitcoin are surging. Adoption is growing and we are at a stage where innovation abounds.</p>

<p>Still today most people have even heard of Bitcoin or Ethereum or Litecoin. And there’s a need to comprehend what cryto-currencies mean in the larger context of human evolution.</p>

<p>A crypto-currency is first and foremost a decentralized means of exchange, store of value and more generally information propagation. Decentralized is the key term. And it’s the concept that frightens most.</p>

<p>Decentralized means going around the pillar of  centralized control. It means obsoleting venerable institutions like traditional banks.</p>

<p>But most importantly it means empowering the decentralized, autonomous individual.</p>

<p>There are many ways to measure the impact of technological evolution. To me the most salient impact is empowerment.</p>

<p>Traditional tribes morphed into villages, later cities until humans gathered under the reassuring umbrella of the nation state. The human herd was and to some extent still is the solution to homo sapiens’ frailty. A a group human fend off packs of wolves, gather and store enough food for everybody and more generally prosper.</p>

<p>Technological advances first improved the city and the nation state from energy production and storage to transportation.</p>

<p>But the latest waves of technological improvement since the computer and internet revolution are for the first time empowering the individual to the point where he might no longer need the herd.</p>

<p>And what Bitcoin and others offer is yet another tool for the decentralized individual, ever more free to make the decisions he wants.</p>
