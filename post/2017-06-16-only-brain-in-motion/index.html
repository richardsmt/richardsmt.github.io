<p>The most important activity for brain growth and health is learning. Constant and varied learning.</p>

<p>From human languages to new workout, from new professional skills to new social behaviors. Learn, always.</p>

<p>Then no age to start and none to stop. Just keep learning.</p>

<p>The learning mantra has always proven true but I feel itâ€™s even more important in our modern world. How best to cope with environmental, social, political and technical changes ? Well, learning, always.</p>
