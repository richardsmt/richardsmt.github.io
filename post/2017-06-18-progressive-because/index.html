        <p>I believe that left to their our devices humans could veer towards inhumanity by unleashing their inner demons.
History has taught us than humans can unleash horror.</p>

<p>The nazis weren&rsquo;t aliens from another planet. They were human. And these humans devised and carried out a massive plan of torture and extermination.</p>

<p>This historic incident repeated itself in various forms and different levels of intensity with the Stalin purges, Pol Pot in Cambodia or even in Rwanda.</p>

<p>I believe humans need to be guided towards a better version of themselves. Hence a strong education system.</p>

<p>What separates me from conservatives and libertarians on the economic and social fronts is that I believe a strong government should protect the free market form the natural monopolistic and self-serving tendencies that come naturally to corporations.</p>

<p>What would happen if one or several US corporations were much bigger and more powerful than the US government. Wouldn&rsquo;t that entail a form of corporate dictatorship? As corporations grow so too must government.</p>

<p>Of course the central issue is what constitute good government and I agree that current incarnations are subpar. However we do need government.</p>

<p>We need regulation. Without it we cannot protect our rivers, our health and the even the free market. Too many poorly designed regulations are bad but do not justify the blanket call against regulations.</p>

<p>This is why I call myself a progressive, irrespective of existing political parties that I generally view unfavorably. Just because a politician call himself a progressive (or conservative for matter) does not mean his actions will math his rhetoric  or that he is above corruption.</p>

<p>So indeed, progressive.</p>
